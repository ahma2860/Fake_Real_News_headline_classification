# Fake vs Real News Headline Classification

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify news headlines as either **Fake** or **Real** using text processing and machine learning techniques.

## Overview
The project involves cleaning text data, extracting features using TF-IDF vectorization, and training models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest for classification.

## Dataset
The dataset includes labeled news headlines categorized as **Fake** or **Real**, stored in CSV format.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Fake_Real_news_headline_classification.ipynb
    ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.

## Results
The best model achieved an accuracy of **X%** with detailed metrics documented in the notebook.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request.
